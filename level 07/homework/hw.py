name = input(type("enter your name:"))

n2 = print("some")

#we cant print string type as int because int stores  numbers
print(int(n2))

#you may ask what does function "type" do type shows us wich type is code str int float ...



num1 = "10"
num2 = "10"

print(int(num1) + (num2))

#you may also aks what does str int or float mean for example this is str""something"" you need to place it in quotes int is "(any number)" u dont need to place it in quotes as like float, float is "(example:7.2)"
